# StudentDb (Student Database) 

## Overview
This project is a **Student Database (StudentDb)** designed to manage undergraduate and graduate student records. The system implements **CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)**
operations, allowing the user to add, view, modify, and remove student records efficiently.
This was developed in the Winter 2025 quarter at the University of Washington in Tacoma. This is one of the assignments apart of the T INFO 200 curriculum and was demonstrated by Charles Costarella. The ideation and conceptial aspect of the assignment is credited towards Costarella however, method of implementation, styling, and use of code is my responsibility.

## Status
This project is currently a work in progress. CRUD functionality has been partially implemented, some features are incomplete or require refining. I plan to continue developing
this project to ensure full functionality and improved performance in the feature. 

## Features
- Add new graduate and undergraduate students
- View student records
- Update student information
- Delete student records
- Disctinction between undergraduate and graduate students

## Technology Used
- Programming Language: C#
- Framwork: .NET Framework 4.8 Console Application

## Future Improvements
- [] Complete CRUD implementation
- [] Improve error handling
- [] Ensure current list of students print to an outfile
- [] Reduce redundancy

## Contributions
The deadline for the assignment has passed so, contributions are welcome however, I would prefer feedback and suggestions!
