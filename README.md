# StudentDb (Student Database) 

## Overview
This project is a **Student Database (StudentDb)** designed to manage undergraduate and graduate student records. The system implements **CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)**
operations, allowing the user to add, view, modify, and remove student records efficiently.

## Status
This project is currently a work in progress. CRUD functionality has been partially implemented, some features are incomplete or require refining. I plan to continue developing
this project to ensure full functionality and improved performance in the feature. 

## Features
- Add new graduate and undergraduate students
- View student records
- Update student information
- Delete student records
- Disctinction between undergraduate and graduate students

## Technology Used
- Programming Language: C#
- Framwork: .NET Framework 4.8 Console Application

## Future Improvements
- [] Complete CRUD implementation
- [] Improve error handling
- [] Ensure current list of students print to an outfile
- [] Reduce redundancy

## Contributions
The deadline for the assignment has passed so, contributions are welcome however, I would prefer feedback and suggestions!
